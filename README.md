# ENGR290-ManagingDelays
Since many students are facing the same issues and struggling with code performance, I've decided to create a short tutorial on delay management.

## Things to consider:  
- The built-in delay() function use Timer_0 to completely halt the program for a given time [[1]].  
- The millis() counts the interrupts generated by Timer_0 overflowing [[1]].  
- The interrupt priority on Timers are set to be: Timer_2 > Timer_1 > Timer_0 [[2]].  
- millis is "unsigned long" [[3]].
